###  krapani_project
# Summary:
An application is intended to be hosted in the cloud. It will be available on both mobile and web. It will be something like reddit and facebook combined. This app requires:
- Instance or serverless service to host it
- Database
- Caching (can use redis, etc)
- Storage for static files (eg. users profile pictures, html assets, etc.)
- Autoscaling to handle traffic
- Any other services you think will be needed
# Bonus Point:
- Integrate CI/CD into the workflow
# Delivery:
- Create a very high-level flow graph on how you will design this.
- Clearly distinguish which services will be in public and private virtual subnets.
- Use Azure or AWS services for your design.
- You can use a tools like https://draw.io (or any tool of your preference) for this
